# AI Usage Disclosure

Quick and honest:
I used ChatGPT as an assistant, not as autopilot.

## Where I used it

1. Tests
- Drafting unit/integration test scaffolding.
- Writing test implementation based on my instructions.
- I explicitly told it where to look and which corner cases to cover.
- After adding tests, I manually reviewed and adjusted logic based on review passes.

2. Boilerplate
- Speeding up repetitive code/structure setup.

3. Types / trait impl
- Helping with basic impl patterns for custom types (`Display`, arithmetic traits for `Amount`, etc.).

4. Review pass
- Catching typos and wording issues.

1. Docs
- Helping draft README text.
